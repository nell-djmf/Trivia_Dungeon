# **Trivia Dungeon**
## **Premise**
You find yourself at the bottom of a dark dungeon, populated by rabid beasts (who happen to be trivia fans). Proceed through the dungeon, answering questions to make it out alive!

## **Gameplay**
The game lasts a total of 10 rounds, with each round including a question phase, and a trap phase if you answer incorrectly.

***
### **Trap Room**
Traps are the penalty phase for a wrong answer. You will be presented with a series of items, most with a penalty, and one safe item that will bring you back to the answer phase.

- **[Just a rock]** Safe item
- **[Tonic of Forgetfulness]** Remove a random answer choice for 3 rounds. This may include the correct answer.
- **[Energy Dampening Cloak]** Forfeit your powers for 3 rounds
- **[Poison-coated Goblet]** Deal 5 damage per round for 3 rounds

***
### **Powers**
Powers may be used at the start of a phase. Number of uses vary per player class.

***
### **HP**
Players start with 100 HP. Each trap phase will inflict 10 damage. Reaching 0 will kill the player, ending the game.

## **Classes**
Classes are grouped into two categories: Light and Dark.
- Light-attuned classes have powers that affect the question phase or the player directly
- Dark-attuned classes have powers that influence the trap phase

Choose your toolkit carefully! Your powers may be the difference between life and death.
