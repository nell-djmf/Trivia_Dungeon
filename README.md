# **Trivia Dungeon**

## **Premise**
You find yourself at the bottom of a dark dungeon, populated by rabid beasts (who happen to be trivia fans). Proceed through the dungeon, answering questions to make it out alive!

## **Gameplay**
The game lasts a total of 10 rounds, with each round including a question phase, and a trap phase if you answer incorrectly.

***
### **Trap Room**
Traps are the penalty phase for a wrong answer. You will be presented with a series of items, most with a penalty, and one safe item that will bring you back to the answer phase.


### **Item List:**
- **[Just a rock]** Safe item
- **[Tonic of Forgetfulness]** Remove a random answer choice for 3 rounds. This may include the correct answer.
- **[Energy Dampening Cloak]** Forfeit your powers for 3 rounds
- **[Poison-coated Goblet]** Deal 5 damage per round for 3 rounds

***

### **HP**
Players start with 100 HP. For an incorrect answer, the encounter will inflict 10 damage. Reaching 0 will kill the player, ending the game.

### **Powers**
Powers may be used at the start of a phase. Number of uses vary per player class.

## **Classes**
Classes are grouped into two categories: Light and Dark.
- Light-attuned classes have powers that affect the question phase or the player directly
- Dark-attuned classes have powers that influence the trap phase

Choose your toolkit carefully! Your powers may be the difference between life and death.

| Class Name | Type | Uses | Power |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **üõ°Ô∏è Paladin** | Light | 3 | **[Divine Blessing]** Pray to the gods for guidance and omit 2 wrong answers |
| **üèπ Archer** | Light | 2 | **[Lightning Reflexes]** Evade a monster to skip a question entirely |
| **üó°Ô∏è Rogue** | Dark | 3 | **[Trap Sense]** Use your uncanny intuition to narrow down item choices to 1 safe item, 1 cursed |
| **ü™Ñ  Wizard** | Dark | 2 | **[Chronomancer]** Alter time to skip 1 trap phase, with no item penalty |

### **Known Bugs:**

- *If questions aren't being fetched, it means I need to get a new link from the API. I believe they expire after a certain amount of time*

- *Rarely, the Tonic of Forgetfulness will not remove random answers. I have not been able to replicate this reliably.*

- *Answering incorrectly still triggers a new question (not visible because of trap room). Removing the new question function call from `phaseCheck()` breaks the game*

- *If you give an incorrect answer that kills you, the traps still show before starting a new game*
